# CVC---Sign-Language-Translator
In college there is a computer vision compition (CVC), we provided an idea for our project which is a translator for arabic letters (some of them)for deaf and mute poeple . 

We developed a machine learning model (we tried many models) to detect 6 arabic characters(ب ت ث س م ك).

Steps of the road we took :
  1) We made a dataset by ourselves but then we found a dataset that can help us as ML model need large dataset.
  2) Image processing is done for captured stream of photos by detecting the hand on image whetether the user appear or not in image and 
    background removal to ease the task for the model.
  3) ML model is trained by those (more than one model is made actually) and tried to reach an acceptable level of accuracy.
  4) Desktop application is developed and GUI is made to be user friendly interface.
